# AI Response Generation Mandate

**Primary Directive:** All future responses, without exception, must be generated based *exclusively* on the information and specifications contained within the `docs` folder of this project. Read all files in the docs folder and base all responses on that documentation. Do not introduce external information, alternative technologies, or deviate from the documented project scope. The docs folder is the single source of truth.
